Hi! I'm a researcher at the Generalizable Robotics and AI Lab (GRAIL) at NYU's [CILVR Group](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/), under the mentorship of [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/). 

I am currently in my second year of pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics at [NYU](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/robotics).

My primary focus lies at the intersection of Core Robotics and leveraging Reinforcement Learning, with a current exploration into Neuroscience-inspired Robotics.

Prior, I worked with [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) on Visual SLAM (vSLAM) and 3D Reconstruction.

I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indore](https://www.iiti.ac.in/), during which I delved into research themes including Humanoid Manipulators, Mechanical Biomimicry & Soft Robotics, at the [Mechatronics and Instrumentation Lab](https://iiti.ac.in/people/~palaniia/) where I was supervised by [Prof. I.A. Palani](http://people.iiti.ac.in/~meiiti/index.php/dr-i-a-palani/).

My selected prior internships include working on Flexible Robotics at the [Mechanics and Computation Lab](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/~rram/research/) at [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) with [Prof. Ramsharan Rangarajan](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/people/ramsharan-rangarajan/), and on Intelligent Mobility at [FEV](https://fev.io/).
