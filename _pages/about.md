Hi! I'm a Founding Research Engineer at a stealth startup. I'm also a PhD student in Computer Science and Robotics at Columbia University.

I got my Master’s degree in Robotics working at the General Purpose Robotics and AI Lab (GRAIL) at NYU's [CILVR Group](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) with [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/). My work focused on multimodal robot learning and democratizing touch sensing - [eFlesh](https://e-flesh.com/) and [AnySkin](https://any-skin.github.io/). I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Indore, where I worked on developing actuators for dexterity.

In my spare time, I enjoy music, tennis and reading.
